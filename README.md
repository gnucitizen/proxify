# Introduction

The idea behind Proxify is to create a proxy that is just good at doing proxying. It is the proxy of all proxies so-to-say. Proxify is lightweight, streamlined, concurrent and very efficient proxy utility that is easy to integrate into other tools. There is a good need for such tools because proxies are quite complex and not trivial to write even if you choose to use a high-level language such as Java, Python or Ruby.

This tool is written in C and comes with all dependencies pre-included in the package. This means that it is very portable on all platforms and you do not need any special setup. Having all files in the same folder is just enough to make it run.

Proxify is multithreaded and can in theory make optimal use of multi-cpu environments. The tool is non-buffering which means that it is really fast. It supports WebSockets, WebRTS and other streaming protocols. It fully understands HTTP. It does SSL interception and clones certificates on the fly.
